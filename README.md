[Libccp](https://github.com/ccp-project/libccp) is an implementation of the core functionality necsesary for a datapath to communicate with a CCP process.

This crate implements Rust bindings for libccp. It is useful for datapaths implemented in Rust which wish to add CCP support. 

If you do not need to create a new datapath and just want to get started using CCP, please see the [guide](https://ccp-project.github.io/ccp-guide/).
